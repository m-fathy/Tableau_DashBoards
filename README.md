Top N Parameters:

Users have the flexibility to set the "Top N" parameter, allowing them to explore the top-performing products, regions, or categories according to their preferences.
Level of Detail (LODs):

LOD expressions are employed in four key charts, providing users with precise insights into complex data relationships and aggregations.
Custom Visuals:

The dashboard features three custom visualizations, including a heat map for sales distribution, a radial chart for geographic insights, and a customized timeline for trend analysis.
Parameterized Measures:

Users can dynamically adjust measure calculations based on two levels: global and local parameters, enabling tailored analysis.
Multiple Dimension Filters:

Multiple dimension filters are available throughout the dashboard, allowing users to slice and dice data according to their specific requirements.
Year-over-Year (YOY) KPI:

A visually striking KPI section displays YOY percentage changes and directional arrows, making it easy to identify trends and improvements.
Month-over-Month (MOM) KPI:

Users can select a reference year using a parameterized input, enabling a detailed comparison between the current month and the same month in the chosen year.
Day-over-Day (DOD) KPI:

The DOD KPI section provides a quick snapshot of daily performance changes, complete with directional arrows for immediate insights.
Sorting by Date:

Months are sorted chronologically by date, ensuring that the dashboard presents a logical progression of time rather than alphabetical order.
