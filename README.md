Super Store Dashboard with Tableau
Overview
The Super Store Dashboard with Tableau is a powerful data analysis and visualization tool designed to offer deep insights into the Super Store's performance. This dynamic dashboard leverages advanced Tableau techniques to facilitate comprehensive data exploration and informed decision-making. It incorporates various interactive elements, custom visuals, and essential key performance indicators (KPIs) to empower users with actionable insights.

Key Features and Techniques
Interactive Chart Switching:

Users can seamlessly switch between different chart types (e.g., bar, line, scatter) on the same dashboard page, allowing for versatile data exploration and comparison.
Multi-Page Navigation:

A user-friendly drop-down list located at the top of the dashboard enables effortless navigation between different dashboard pages, each dedicated to specific aspects of the Super Store's operations.
Drill-Down Capability:

With a simple click, users can drill down into specific data points, revealing finer-grained details and trends within the selected category or dimension.
Hierarchy and Context Filters:

The dashboard incorporates hierarchical filtering and context filters, ensuring that users can focus on subsets of data that are most relevant to their analysis.![FIRST DASH](https://github.com/m-fathy/Tableau_DashBoards/assets/63368183/1da52406-f427-4e91-b6c2-4d54a27070b6)


Top N Parameters:

Users have the flexibility to set the "Top N" parameter, allowing them to explore the top-performing products, regions, or categories according to their preferences.
Level of Detail (LODs):

LOD expressions are employed in four key charts, providing users with precise insights into complex data relationships and aggregations.
Custom Visuals:

The dashboard features three custom visualizations, including a heat map for sales distribution, a radial chart for geographic insights, and a customized timeline for trend analysis.
Parameterized Measures:

Users can dynamically adjust measure calculations based on two levels: global and local parameters, enabling tailored analysis.
Multiple Dimension Filters:

Multiple dimension filters are available throughout the dashboard, allowing users to slice and dice data according to their specific requirements.
Year-over-Year (YOY) KPI:

A visually striking KPI section displays YOY percentage changes and directional arrows, making it easy to identify trends and improvements.
Month-over-Month (MOM) KPI:

Users can select a reference year using a parameterized input, enabling a detailed comparison between the current month and the same month in the chosen year.
Day-over-Day (DOD) KPI:

The DOD KPI section provides a quick snapshot of daily performance changes, complete with directional arrows for immediate insights.
Sorting by Date:

Months are sorted chronologically by date, ensuring that the dashboard presents a logical progression of time rather than alphabetical order.
